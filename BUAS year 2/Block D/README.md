# Plant Segmentation and Landmark Detection Application

## Overview
The **Plant Segmentation and Landmark Detection Application** is designed for plant science researchers at the Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Centre (NPEC). The objective of this project is to create a modular and scalable Python package that performs organ segmentation and landmark detection on plant images. This application enables researchers to train models using their own datasets, deploy them on Azure, and perform inference through a web interface, API, or command-line interface (CLI).

## Project Description
The application leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to facilitate the analysis of plant images, specifically targeting the segmentation of plant organs and the detection of key landmarks. By integrating MLOps best practices, the system aims to provide a robust, user-friendly experience for plant researchers, allowing them to extract valuable insights from their data and enhance their experimental workflows.

## What We Did
- **Consolidated the PoC**: Integrated various proof-of-concept notebooks and scripts into a cohesive Python package, ensuring modularity for ease of maintenance and extensibility.
- **Developed a CLI**: Created a user-friendly command-line interface that supports functionality such as training, evaluation, and inference.
- **Implemented MLOps Practices**: Established Azure data environments, automated training pipelines, and CI/CD practices to enhance scalability and maintainability.
- **API Development**: Developed a RESTful API for model deployment, ensuring secure access and authentication.
- **Documentation**: Provided comprehensive documentation for the package, CLI, API, and MLOps processes, including installation and usage instructions.

## Skills Gained
- **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)**: Gained practical knowledge in managing data environments, automating training pipelines, and deploying machine learning models using Azure.
- **Python Development**: Improved skills in Python programming, particularly in creating modular packages and adhering to best practices like PEP8 guidelines.
- **API Design and Development**: Learned how to design and implement RESTful APIs for model deployment and interaction.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Development**: Developed expertise in creating user-friendly CLI applications for enhanced usability.
- **Version Control and Collaboration**: Enhanced skills in using Git for version control and collaboration on software projects.
