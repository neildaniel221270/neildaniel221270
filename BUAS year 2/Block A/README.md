# AI in Media Studies at BUAS

## Project Description
As part of a collaborative team at Breda University of Applied Sciences (BUAS), we investigated the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the university's media studies program, focusing on students, faculty, and the institution as a whole. Through a mixed-methods approach combining both qualitative and quantitative research, we aimed to understand perceptions and attitudes toward AI. Our efforts culminated in a comprehensive research paper, policy recommendations, and an interactive PowerPoint presentation, which was presented at a conference. The findings provided actionable strategies for BUAS and its Media studies department.

## Data Collection & Analysis
I took a leading role in designing and implementing a detailed survey using Qualtrics to gather quantitative data. My team and I supplemented the survey with in-depth interviews of both lecturers and students, gaining valuable qualitative insights. I was responsible for data preprocessing and analysis using R scripting, which allowed us to identify important trends and extract meaningful patterns from the data.

## Visualization & Presentation
Leveraging Râ€™s data visualization capabilities, our team created a series of dynamic and interactive graphs that illustrated the study's key findings. These visualizations were incorporated into our final PowerPoint presentation, which was presented at a major conference. The presentation clearly conveyed the research results, along with strategic recommendations for integrating AI into the media studies curriculum at BUAS.

## Stakeholder Collaboration
We actively collaborated with key stakeholders in the media department to ensure that our research aligned with the needs of both the university and the industry. Regular check-ins with faculty and administration ensured that our findings were relevant, resulting in more targeted and practical recommendations.

## Impact & Personal Growth
This project provided BUAS with insightful data on how AI is perceived across the media studies community and offered guidance on future curriculum development. For me, this experience sharpened my skills in data analysis, stakeholder management, and strategic problem-solving. Additionally, it deepened my understanding of both qualitative and quantitative research techniques.
