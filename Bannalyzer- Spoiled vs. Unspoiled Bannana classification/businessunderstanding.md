## use case 1

### Step 1

**1.	What image classifier product/product feature could make customers' lives easier?**

A product that can accurately identify objects and provide detailed information about them. For example, to identify and classify different types of food items in a grocery store could make it easier for customers to find and purchase the products they need. This could be especially useful for customers with dietary restrictions or preferences, who need to quickly identify certain types of foods while shopping.

**2. How can I improve my customers' experience?**

I can improve my customers experience by making the product easy to use/ navigate through using clear instructions and a good user interface. I could also allow the user to use customer support

**3.	What problem can I alleviate for my customers?**

I could alleviate the problem of waiting in the line for long or having a slow checkout. 

**4.	What are the unmet needs of my customers?**


**5. Are current products on the market meeting customers' expectations? If not, what is lacking?**



### Step 2

This product will take a picture of the bannana and it will tell you if the bannana is spoiled or healthy to eat.

## Use case 2

### Step 1

**Segment consumers interested in your application into groups based on information provided during the independent study day.**

- Demographic segmentation: the application may be more appealing to health-conscious consumers who are interested in buying high-quality, fresh produce and are willing to pay a premium for it.
- Geographic segmentation: the application may be more useful in areas where bananas are a staple food and are readily available, such as in tropical regions.
- Psychographic segmentation: the application may be more appealing to environmentally-conscious consumers who are interested in reducing food waste and improving the sustainability of their food choices.
- Behavioral segmentation: the application may be more useful for consumers who frequently buy bananas and are interested in ensuring that they are of high quality.
### Step 2

**Evaluate each segment and pick your target.**

Behavioral segmentation: By segmenting the market this way, I can designthe application to the specific needs and characteristics of the group of consumers. This can help to increase the adoption and usage of the application, and ultimately, its success in the marketplace.
### Step 3 

**Use the template you have created for your persona to prepare for the DataLab and fill it in. Within the persona, make sure to explain the value your application will create for your user.** (Look at Project proposal presentation)

### Setp 4

**Adjust your project proposal for the computer vision application based on created persona. The adjusted project proposal should be based on the satisfaction of needs of your consumer which were identified during the creation of the persona. Personal features of your persona should be taken into consideration too. For example, if you find out that your end-users are not tech-savvy and relatively old; you might propose to create a computer vision application that is extremely user-friendly and self-explanatory. Therefore, you need to make your project proposal for the computer vision application as consumer-oriented as possible, keeping in mind all the personal features and needs of your persona.** (Look at Project proposal presentation)

## Use case 3

### Step 1

**Attend the lecture on disruptive technologies and, using disruptive technology risks from the lecture slides Week 7.** Done.

**identify/explain risks that applicable for your computer vision application.**

- False positives: There is a risk that the application may incorrectly classify a non-spoiled banana as spoiled, leading to unnecessary waste of food and potential financial losses for consumers or retailers.
- False negatives: Conversely, there is a risk that the application may incorrectly classify a spoiled banana as non-spoiled, potentially leading to foodborne illness or other health risks for consumers.

**fill the project proposal presentation.** (Look at Project proposal presentation)

### Step 2

**Address the disruptive technology risk in the project proposal for the application and complete the AI canvas.** (Look at Project proposal presentation)

Economic disruption: If the application proves to be highly effective at detecting banana spoilage, it could lead to economic disruption in the banana industry. For example, it could lead to a decrease in the demand for visually inspecting bananas and result in job losses for workers in the industry.
