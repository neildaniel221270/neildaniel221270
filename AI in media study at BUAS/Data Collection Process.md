## Data Collection Process:
 **Quantitative:**

 We collected our quantitative data using surveys, which will be administered using the Qualtrics platform. They will be distributed to all current students and staff at BUAS. The survey responses will be collected and saved in a .csv file format, which can be viewed using Excel, VScode or Rstudio. To analyze the survey results, a script written in the coding language 'R' will be employed. This will enable us to thoroughly explore, manipulate, and visualize the data to its fullest potential.

 **Qualtitative:**

 We collected qualitative by interviewing students in a focus group and by interviewing staff in a one-on-one setting.

***Focus Group:***
    We will conduct interviews in both focus groups and one-on-one settings. Focus groups will comprise 5 to 8 participants. 
 
 ***Interviews:***
 Interviews will be transcripted, and detailed notes will be taken during the sessions, which will then be compiled into a Word document. These interviews will involve lecturers, with a minimum of 10 interviews planned. The recorded interviews will be saved in '.vtt' format, and a program like Rstudio, NotePad, Word, Vscode can be utilized to access these files
