## Data Storage Protocol:
 **Documentation and Metadata:**

 In order to enhance the usability of data for colleagues and fellow researchers/partners, it is crucial to include thorough documentation. This documentation should describe key characteristics of the dataset, including
 - Data format (file type) and the required software for utilization.
 - Details about the data collection process, specifying the tools and instruments employed (e.g., lab journal, logbook, diary, etc.).
 - The data is stored in a CSV file downloaded from Qualtrics.
 - The data was collected through a survey utilizing the website qualtrics.com, and was disseminated across BUas through various channels to both students and staff.

**Filenaming and folder structure:**

 To ensure that research data is easily discoverable and comprehensible, it is imperative to maintain a structured and consistent approach to file organization. Elements of a file name should include:
 - Project acronym.
 - Content description (Interview, Survey, Email).
 - File type information (Audio, Transcript, Text).
 - Date (format: DD-MM-YYYY).
 - Creator name or initials.
 - Version number.
 - Use "_" to separate the different elements within a file name.

 Establishing a meaningful folder structure, and have well-named files, facilitates efficient file retrieval. For collaborative projects, maintaining an organized folder hierarchy becomes even more crucial. It is recommended to limit the folder depth to 3 or 4 levels and avoid overcrowding each folder with too many files. In this case, the files are named as follows:
 - RawQualtricsData.csv
 - CleanedQualtricsData.csv
These two files are stored in separate folders with corresponding names.

**Version control:**
 Managing different versions of data/files can be accomplished through various methods:
 - GitHub offers version control features, allowing users to track the last modification date, the person responsible, and obtain a history overview of the file.
 - Recording the date directly within the file.
 - Including a version number in the filename (eg. 07022020_interview_BUaslibrary_transcript_v2.txt).
 - Indicating the status of the file, such as 'draft' or 'final', while avoiding potentially confusing statuses like 'final2' or 'final_revised'.
 - After each file change or new file a desciption should be made to give a clear view of the changes made to the file.
 - GithHub also offers the possibility to go back and view previous versions of the file.

In this study, two distinct versions of the datafile exist: one cleaned and the other uncleaned. These files are stored in Sharepoint and appropriately named as well.

**Readme Files:**

Readme files should contain supplementary information related to the raw data collection process. They serve as a guide for other researchers aiming to interpret or reanalyze the datasets. The recommended format for a readme text is a plain text file.
