# SDG Dashboard Project

## Project Description
This project focuses on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations in 2015, specifically SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, and SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. Using data analytics and visualization techniques, this dashboard allows policymakers, researchers, activists, and the general public to monitor and assess progress toward these SDGs on both global and country-specific levels. It provides insights into disparities in access to safe drinking water, links between economic factors, and progress in achieving these essential goals.

## Research Questions
1. What is needed to access safe drinking water, and is it possible to implement these solutions in the poorest countries in the world?
2. What do "rich countries" have in common that "poor countries" do not, affecting the percentage of safe drinking water?

## Key Findings
- **Safe Drinking Water Comparison**: The dashboard shows significant disparities in access to safe drinking water between countries like the Netherlands, Japan, and New Zealand, which have near-complete access, and countries such as Sierra Leone, Chad, and the Central African Republic, where access is severely limited.
- **Coverage by Service Level**: The rich countries provide “at least basic” or “safely managed services,” while poorer countries still rely on “unimproved,” “limited service,” or even “surface water” as their drinking water sources.
- **Economic Correlation**: A positive correlation is observed between GDP per capita and access to safe drinking water. Increases in GDP in countries such as Sierra Leone and Chad have corresponded with increased access to safe drinking water.
- **Life Expectancy**: No significant correlation was found between life expectancy and access to safe drinking water, indicating that factors other than health outcomes also play a key role.

## Skills Gained
- Data Analytics: Analyzing complex datasets related to SDGs, particularly around safe drinking water, health, and economic growth.
- Data Visualization: Creating interactive dashboards to visualize the comparisons between different countries.
- Correlation Analysis: Understanding the relationships between variables like GDP per capita, access to water, and life expectancy.
- Research and Reporting: Investigating global disparities and offering insights based on data to support SDG goals.

## Usage
This interactive dashboard serves as a decision-making tool for policymakers and activists aiming to track progress on SDGs. It also raises public awareness about the disparities in global access to clean water, promoting collective action towards a more sustainable and equitable future.
