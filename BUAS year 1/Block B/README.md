# Banijay TV Viewership Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project focuses on the application of digital transformation to improve business processes for Banijay Group, a global content creation and distribution company. The primary objective is to analyze Banijay's TV viewership metrics and identify key factors that drive show popularity. As data scientists, our task was to evaluate how various data sources, including social media metrics (e.g., Twitter activity), can help predict TV ratings and improve decision-making processes within the company.

## Research Question
Can we predict the ratings (Kdh000) of a TV show based on Twitter metrics, and how can Banijay improve the accuracy and effectiveness of these predictions?

## Key Findings
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using Twitter metrics, we developed a predictive model to estimate TV show ratings. The model confirms a potential correlation between Twitter engagement and ratings, but the initial results were not highly accurate due to a low coefficient of determination (R² score).
- **Model Improvement**: The R² score could be enhanced by introducing additional independent variables to better explain variations in the dependent variable (TV ratings). Further optimization is also possible through hyperparameter tuning and using validation sets.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Banijay has strong ethical policies regarding data collection, protection, and overall corporate responsibility. However, one area of improvement is in diversifying their workforce to bring more diverse perspectives, which could foster more creative problem-solving and innovation.

## Skills Gained
- **Business Intelligence**: Gained experience in utilizing data sources and applying machine learning to a real-world business process for improving decision-making.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Built and tested a predictive model for TV ratings based on social media metrics, and explored the potential for improving model performance through additional data and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Data Ethics**: Analyzed and reflected on Banijay's data ethics, considering both legal and ethical concerns around data privacy, as well as exploring the importance of diversity in the workplace.
- **Power BI and Machine Learning**: Applied tools such as Power BI for data visualization and machine learning models to explore patterns and drive insights.

## Usage
This project demonstrates how digital transformation and data-driven approaches can be applied to the entertainment industry. By refining data processes and improving model accuracy, Banijay can better understand audience preferences and maximize viewership. This study offers insights that can be expanded in future projects, focusing on deeper integration of multi-source data for even more robust predictive analytics.
