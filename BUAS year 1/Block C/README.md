# Bannalyzer: Image Classification for Banana Freshness

## Project Description
This project was developed in collaboration with the Innovation Square at Breda University of Applied Sciences, focusing on the use of deep learning for image classification. The aim was to design a machine learning-based image classifier that could provide meaningful business or societal impact. The resulting application, **Bannalyzer**, classifies bananas as either spoiled or not based on their images. By allowing users to quickly assess the freshness of bananas, this project aims to promote food safety, reduce foodborne illness, and minimize food waste.

## Research Questions
Can deep learning-based image classification help consumers determine the freshness of bananas, and how can this application reduce food waste while promoting food safety?

## Key Findings
- **CNN-Based Image Classification**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of bananas as "spoiled" or "not spoiled." The model achieved robust performance after preprocessing the images with OpenCV and using Keras ImageDataGenerator for image augmentation.
- **User-Centered Application**: A prototype application, **Bannalyzer**, was created to provide users with an easy-to-use interface for capturing and classifying images of bananas. While the application is in its early stages, the potential for real-world utility is clear.
- **Business Value and Societal Impact**: The application offers significant value by helping consumers make better decisions about their food, reducing waste, and improving food safety. Early identification of spoiled bananas could prevent unnecessary purchases and reduce the risk of foodborne illness.

## Skills Gained
- **Deep Learning**: Developed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks, using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Image Processing**: Gained experience in preprocessing image datasets using Python libraries like OpenCV and enhancing model performance through techniques such as data augmentation.
- **Prototype Development**: Designed and implemented a user-centered application that integrates machine learning into a consumer-facing tool aimed at reducing food waste.
- **Market Research and Risk Assessment**: Conducted an analysis of market needs and the potential risks associated with developing a consumer-focused application in the food safety domain.

## Usage
The **Bannalyzer** application serves as a potential tool for consumers, grocers, and even food safety organizations to monitor the freshness of bananas. By leveraging deep learning and image classification, it aims to reduce food waste and improve decision-making around perishable foods. This project could be further developed into a viable product that offers both societal benefits and business value, potentially transforming into a market-ready solution with the support of industry partners.
