# ALTAI Framework

The Ethics Guidelines that introduced the concept of Trustworthy AI identified seven key requirements. These seven key requirements together form the basis for building Trustworthy AI systems. By looking at these, AI developers and organizations can improve transparency, fairness, safety, human control, and accountability in the development and deployment of this project, fostering trust with the  users and stakeholders. Let's look at each of them and understand why they are important:

## 1. Human Agency and Oversight:
### Human agency and autonomy
This part of the ALTAI framework is important because we are creating a dashboard that is aimed at guiding/ influencing/ supporting humans in decision making processes. 
### Human Oversight
This part of the ALTAI framework is not important for this project as this AI-system does not make any decisions. So humans already have control of the final decision.

## 2. Technical Robustness and Safety:
### Resilience to attacks and security
This requirement of the ALTAI framework is not important because we are just sending a dashboard to the municipality. We do not need to worry about using the dashboard in the wrong way, so it will not cause damaging effects.
### General safety
This requirement of the ALTAI framework is important for this project because it is important to implement measures to ensure the reliability, accuracy, and safety of the livability score calculation. It is also important to test and validate the algorithms used to generate the score to minimize errors and potential risks.
### Accuracy
This requirement of the ALTAI framework is important as you want the machine learning model we are making to be as accurate as possible.
### Reliability, Fall-back plans and Reproducibility
This requirement of the ALTAI framework is not important. The reliability part though is important as this model is designed to assist decision makers. So the model has to be reliable.

## 3. Privacy and Data Governance:
### Privacy
This part of the ALTAI framework is not important as we do not use any personal data. All the data we use is generalized in a neighbourhood level. There is no need to put measures to protect user privacy according to legal/ ethical standards.
### Data Governance
This part of the ALTAI framework is important because We do need to be careful with the data that we are using, as there is some data that is not public. So we need to make sure that the data is not shared anyway outside of this project. So we do need to implement data security, handle the data properly throughout its lifecycle. 

## 4. Transparency:
### Traceability
This part of the ALTAI framework is important as we do need to self-assess whether the processes of the development of the AI system, the data and processes that yield the AI systemâ€™s decisions, is properly documented to allow for traceability, increase transparency. So we need to make the calculation methodology and underlying factors used for the livability score transparent to users.
### Explainability
This part of the ALTAI framework is important as we need to be able to provide a clear and accessible explaination about how the livability score is calculated. This includes detailing the factors and criteria considered, the weightage assigned to each factor, and any limitations or assumptions in the scoring methodology.
### Communication
This part of the ALTAI framework is important as we need to communicate with the rest of the team and the product owner and to the users about the capabilities/ limitations of the model.

## 5. Diversity, Non-Discrimination, and Fairness:
### Avoidance of unfair bias
This part of the ALTAI framework is not important as we do not use any data that is personal, all the data we use is generalized in a neighbourhood level. But just incase we will need to check for potential biases in the data and algorithms used to calculate the livability score. Mitigate any biases to ensure fair representation and treatment of different neighborhoods and demographic groups.
### Accessibility and universal design
This part of the ALTAI framework is not important as we need the client to be able to use the product that we deliver. So we need to design the dashboard in a way that empowers users to understand and interpret the livability score. Maybe even provide options for users to customize or adjust the weightage of different factors based on their preferences and priorities.
### Stakeholder participation
This part of the ALTAI framework is important as we need to make a product that the product owner is satisfied with. So we need to communicate with the stakeholder frequently to ask, implement feedback on the product.

## 6. Environmental and Societal Well-being:
### Environmental well-being
This part of the ALTAI framework is not important as we are just showing the factors that will affect the livability score of Breda.
### Impact on work, skills
This part of the ALTAI framework is not important as we are just providing a dashboard that will assist them in their work.
### Impact on Society at large or Democracy
This part of the ALTAI framework is not important as we are just providing a dashboard that will assist them in their work to continue to improve Breda as a better place to live.

## 7. Accountability:
### Audibility
This part of the ALTAI framework is important because we need to be able to get feedback from the users to improve the product. So we need to establish clear lines of responsibility and accountability for the accuracy and fairness of the livability score. Consider mechanisms for user feedback, reporting errors or discrepancies, and addressing concerns or grievances.
### Risk Management
This part of the ALTAI framework is important because we need to have measurments put in place to ensure responsibility for the development, deployment of the product. This could be done by identifying and mitigating risks in a transparent way that can be explained. So we need to come up with clear lines of responsibility and accountability for the accuracy and fairness of the livability score. We need to make a for the users for reporting errors or discrepancies, and addressing concerns about the product.
